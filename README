This is a package to hold common definitions of what Perl function and method
signatures should look like and how they behave along with a test suite.  The
documentation is in lib/Perl/Signatures/Common.pod and the tests are in t/

The intent is that signature authors will implement a common subset of this API,
clearly define where they extend or differ from it, and make use of the tests
to ensure a robust implementation.

This is to be a collaboration between the contributors to the various Perl signature
modules.  If you're one of them and don't have a commit bit, please let us know.

There is NO CODE HERE just docs and tests.  If you want function signatures
in Perl, please use one of these fine modules.
