This is a package to hold common definitions of what Perl function and method
signatures should look like and how they behave along with a test suite.

The intent is that signature authors will implement a common subset of this API,
clearly define where they extend or differ from it, and make use of the tests
to ensure a robust implementation.

There is NO CODE HERE just docs and tests.  If you want function signatures
in Perl, please use one of these fine modules.

* Method::Signatures::Simple
* Method::Signatures
* signatures
* MooseX::Method::Signatures
